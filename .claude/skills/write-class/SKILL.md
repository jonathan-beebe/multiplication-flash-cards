# Writing a class

A class bundles state with the operations that guard it. Writing one is a design
act, not just a coding act — you're drawing a boundary, defining a public
contract, and deciding what to encapsulate, before any method body is written.

Related skills: name the class with the `naming` skill (noun phrase naming a
role, concrete over generic). Write each method body with the
`write-class-method` skill. Extract logic into pure functions with the
`write-function` skill. Layer placement and dependency direction come from the
`architecture` skill.

## Rules

- **Named first** — use the `naming` skill (class rules: noun phrase naming a
  role, concrete over generic, no verb-in-disguise names). If you can't name the
  role crisply, the boundary is wrong — go back to shaping, not to a thesaurus.
- **Justify its existence** — a class exists to _model_: (1) a real-world object
  or concept that makes sense as an encapsulated unit, or (2) something best
  expressed as an object in an object-oriented codebase. A class is a convenient
  way to group state with the methods that operate on it to model that object —
  typically owning an invariant to protect across operations. It is _not_ a
  grouping of utility functions: everything that can be a plain function should
  be one (see `write-function`), and a drawer of related functions with no
  object to model wanted to be a module. The methods of a justified class may
  still be thin wrappers over pure functions (see "keep the class light" below)
  — the justification is the modeled concept, not the method bodies.
- **Single responsibility** — one role, one reason to change, describable in a
  sentence without "and". A class is _one_ concept made operational, not a
  drawer of related utilities.
- **Boundaries before methods** — decide what the class _owns_ before writing
  what it _does_: which state it holds, which invariant it guards, which
  decisions are its versus its collaborators'. A method that mostly operates on
  another object's data marks a boundary drawn in the wrong place.
- **The public API is a contract**
  - Design it from the caller's side — sketch the ideal call sites first, then
    build the class that satisfies them.
  - Small and deliberate: every public member is a promise you must keep;
    everything defaults to private and is promoted only when a caller
    demonstrates the need.
  - Expose behavior, not state — no getter/setter pairs mirroring fields.
    Callers ask the object to do things; they don't reach in, compute, and write
    back.
- **Encapsulate the private bits** — the invariant must be unbreakable from
  outside: no leaking mutable internals, no back doors. Internals are mechanism,
  free to change without touching any caller; if changing a private field breaks
  callers, encapsulation has already failed.
- **Keep the class light — delegate to the functional core**
  - The class is a thin stateful wrapper; the real computation lives in pure
    functions it imports (the core, trusted functional libraries). A method's
    shape: read own state → call pure function → store or return the result.
  - Balance point: the class owns _state, lifecycle, and sequencing_; the
    functions own _logic_. Lean hard toward the functions — a heavy class is
    untestable logic hiding behind a constructor.
  - When a method grows domain `if`s, extract them to a pure function
    (`write-function`) and call it — logic drifts toward the core (see
    `architecture`).
- **Construction establishes the invariant**
  - An instance is valid from birth: the constructor receives everything needed
    and rejects bad values. No two-phase `init()`, no objects that exist in a
    not-yet-usable state.
  - Collaborators arrive via the constructor as interfaces the inner layer owns
    (dependency inversion) — never reached for from inside.
  - Constructors store and validate; they don't compute or do I/O. Work happens
    in methods, wiring happens in the composition root.
- **Hierarchy: as flat as possible, composition first**
  - Default is _no_ hierarchy. Inheritance only for a true is-a with a stable
    base contract where every subtype substitutes cleanly (LSP); otherwise
    compose, or share an interface instead of a parent.
  - When a hierarchy is genuinely sensible, keep it one level deep from an
    abstract base or interface. Deep trees couple every leaf to every ancestor's
    decisions.
- **SOLID, applied at this altitude** — single responsibility (above); open for
  extension via new implementations and composition, closed to edits of working
  code; substitutable subtypes; small role-specific interfaces rather than one
  fat one; depend on abstractions the core owns, not on concretions.
- **Testable** — constructible in isolation: real core functions, fakes only for
  injected adapter interfaces. If constructing it for a test is painful, it owns
  too much; if testing it requires mocking its own internals, the boundary is
  wrong.
- **Communicates to peers** — the public surface _is_ the documentation: a peer
  can use the class correctly without reading its internals. The class name plus
  its method list should read as a coherent role, not a grab bag.
