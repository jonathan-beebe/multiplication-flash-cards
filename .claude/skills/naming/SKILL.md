# Naming

This file ensures the names of our variables, functions, classes, types,
modules, and files all have meaning and fit our design.

Naming is a design probe: if you can't name a thing honestly and briefly, the
design is wrong — an "and" in a function name means split it; a class you can
only call a bare, unqualified `Manager` or `Helper` means the concept isn't
crisp yet. When a name won't come, go back to the design skill for that artifact
(`write-function`, `write-class`, `write-class-method`, `architecture`), not to
a thesaurus.

## Universal rules (apply to everything)

- Honest — the name covers everything the thing does and nothing it doesn't.
- Intent over implementation — name what it's _for_, not how it works (`cache`,
  not `hashMap`).
- Length proportional to scope — `i` is fine in a 3-line loop; an exported
  symbol gets a fully descriptive name.
- One word per concept, one concept per word — pick `fetch` OR `get` OR `load`
  for a given meaning and use it everywhere. Know the domain of the project and
  the vocabulary of the codebase and defer where a clear vocabulary has been
  established; otherwise stick with the conventions and common language you are
  working in.
- Domain vocabulary over invented terms.
- Role suffixes vs noise words — a shared suffix is _good_ when it names a real
  category with one consistent meaning, applied to every member of the family
  (`*View`, `*Repository`, `*Error`, `use*` for hooks). It's noise when it adds
  no information (`data`, `info`, `stuff`) or means something different every
  time it appears (`Manager` that variously caches, validates, and coordinates).
  Two tests: (1) delete the word — if nothing is lost, it's noise; (2) do all
  names carrying it share a shape/contract? If yes, it's a family marker; keep
  it and enforce it. `Manager` is a role some code occupies, but there is
  usually a more specific verb for the kind of managing being done —
  `Processor`, `Publisher`, `Orchestrator` — and a more specific verb than those
  in turn; prefer the most specific word that stays honest.
- Coordination is a real level — some layer must orchestrate: sequence steps,
  route between components, own a lifecycle. Role words like `Controller`,
  `Orchestrator`, `Coordinator`, `Router` are legitimate _at that level_, with
  two requirements: (1) qualify the role with its scope — a _workflow_
  orchestrator, a _feature_ controller (`CheckoutWorkflowOrchestrator`,
  `ProfileFeatureController`), never a bare `Controller` or `Manager`; (2) the
  name is only honest if the thing _only_ coordinates — it delegates the real
  work to the lower-level pieces it sequences. If it also computes, validates,
  or persists, the name is lying. These words never belong on low-level
  functions or plain data objects.
- Always favor the affirmative — what something is or does, not what it isn't or
  doesn't do.
- Booleans read as assertions — `isValid`, `hasChildren`, `canRetry`; never
  negated (`isNotReady`).
- Conventional pairs — begin/end, open/close, add/remove, create/destroy.
- Include units/qualifiers when ambiguous — `timeoutMs`, `widthPx`.
- Searchable and pronounceable.

## Per-artifact rules

- **Variable / constant** — noun naming a _value_. Plural for collections.
  Boolean assertion form. Constants named for meaning (`MAX_RETRIES`), not
  value.
- **Function** — verb phrase, and the name must carry _full context_ because a
  function stands alone at the call site.
  - Pure, value-returning: name the result — `computeTotal`, `parseDate`,
    `fullName(user)`.
  - Side-effecting: imperative verb naming the effect — `saveUser`, `sendEmail`.
    The verb is what makes the effect visible.
  - Predicates: `isX` / `hasX` / `canX`. Transformations: `toX` / `xFromY` /
    `formatX`.
  - Banned vague verbs: `handle`, `process`, `manage`, `do`.
- **Method** — same verb rules as functions, but the receiver is the implicit
  subject, so the name _borrows context from the object_ and must not repeat it:
  `user.save()` not `user.saveUser()`; `cart.add(item)` not
  `cart.addItemToCart(item)`. Test: read the call site aloud as a sentence —
  `account.withdraw(50)`. Queries named for the value returned, commands named
  for the effect (pairs with command/query separation).
- **Class / object** — noun phrase naming a _role or concept_, never an action.
  Concrete over generic — but split port from adapter: an interface is named in
  domain language for the role it plays (`PaymentGateway`), and only the
  concrete implementation names the technology (`StripePaymentGateway`). Vendor
  and technology words belong on adapters, never on the interfaces the rest of
  the code depends on. Vague role words (`PaymentManager`) are wrong at both
  levels. A verb-in-disguise class name (`Validator`, `Processor`) usually means
  a function wanted to exist — qualified coordination-level roles are the
  exception (see coordination rule above). Instances named for their role in
  context (`primaryButton`, not `button1`).
- **Type / interface** — name the capability or shape (`Clock`, `Serializable`,
  `UserRepository`). Meaningful type params when non-trivial (`Key`, `Row`) —
  bare `T` only for simple containers.
- **Event** — past-tense fact in domain language: `OrderPlaced`,
  `PaymentCaptured`. An event records something that _happened_, so it is never
  imperative (`PlaceOrder` is a command) and never technical
  (`OrderUpdateMessage` names the plumbing, not the fact). Applies anywhere
  events appear: DOM/custom events, analytics events, log events, pub/sub
  topics.
- **Module / file** — named for the concept it exports; file name matches its
  primary export.

**Summary of the differences:** a variable names a value, a function name
carries its own full context, a method name is completed by its receiver, a
class names a role, an event names a past fact, a module names a concept.
