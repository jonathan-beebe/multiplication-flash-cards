  How to diagram the shape and design of systems, features, modules, and files —
  Mermaid diagrams written into markdown docs that live next to the thing they
  capture. Use when designing or documenting structure, boundaries, data flow,
  or interactions, or when the architecture skill needs to draw what it is
  designing.

# Diagramming

Diagrams capture the shape of a design: boundaries, dependencies, data flow,
interactions. They are written as Mermaid blocks inside markdown docs, and each
doc lives next to the thing it diagrams — so the diagram and the code change
together.

Related skills: the `architecture` skill decides the shape; this skill draws it.
Name the doc and the elements in it with the `naming` skill.

## Where a doc lives

A doc is a sibling of its subject, at the subject's altitude:

- **System** — a large system's doc lives at the top of the file hierarchy it
  captures (e.g. the repo root, or the root of that system's tree).
- **Feature / module** — the doc lives inside the folder it captures, next to
  the folder's files.
- **File** — the doc is a sibling of the file it captures.

Name the doc for its subject (see `naming` — a module names a concept): a doc
capturing `checkout/` lives at `checkout/checkout.md`; a doc capturing `cart.ts`
lives beside it as `cart.md`. A system-level doc may be `architecture.md` at the
root of that system.

## Choosing a diagram type

Pick the diagram that answers the question being asked; use several small
diagrams over one that answers everything.

- **C4-style diagrams** — the system altitude: deployables, external systems,
  and the contracts between them. Context for "what talks to this system";
  Container for "what deployables compose it"; Component for the major parts
  inside one deployable. Draw these as flowcharts (subgraphs for boundaries,
  labeled edges for contracts) — Mermaid's `C4Context`/`C4Container` syntax
  renders poorly, so we don't use it (decided 2026-07-05).
- **Flowcharts** (`flowchart TD` / `LR`) — structure and dependency: layers,
  module boundaries, folder shape, which piece imports which. Dependency arrows
  point inward (see `architecture` — layers); a diagram that shows them pointing
  outward or in a cycle is showing a design defect, not a drawing mistake.
- **Data flow diagrams** (`flowchart` with labeled edges) — how data moves
  through the pipeline: data → server API → client fetch → view. Label each edge
  with the data or contract that crosses it (DTO, event, schema).
- **Sequence diagrams** (`sequenceDiagram`) — interactions over time: a
  feature's end-to-end flow, a protocol between deployables, the coordination
  layer sequencing core and adapters.
- **State diagrams** (`stateDiagram-v2`) — the core's state transitions: states,
  events, and the pure transitions between them.
- **Class diagrams** (`classDiagram`) — only when relationships between classes
  are the point (composition, interfaces, the rare hierarchy). Not for restating
  what the code already says plainly.
- **ER diagrams** (`erDiagram`) — the data store's shape and relationships.

## Rules

- **One diagram, one question.** Every diagram exists to answer a specific
  question ("what are the deployables?", "how does an order flow?"). State the
  question as prose above the diagram. If a diagram answers two questions, split
  it.
- **Few boxes.** A diagram a reader can't hold in their head has the same
  problem as a system they can't (see `architecture` — system shape). Aim for
  roughly 5–9 elements; past that, move up an altitude and let a lower doc hold
  the detail.
- **Boundaries and contracts are the content.** The valuable information is what
  crosses each boundary and in which direction — label edges with the contract,
  event, or data that flows, not just lines between boxes.
- **Names match the code.** Boxes carry the real names of the modules, classes,
  and deployables they represent (see `naming`), so the diagram stays greppable
  against the source.
- **Diagrams follow the design, at the design's altitude.** Draw what the
  `architecture` skill decided — layers, deployables, one-way data flow — and
  omit detail from lower altitudes; that's the code's job, or a lower doc's.
- **A stale diagram is worse than none.** Because the doc is a sibling of its
  subject, changing the subject's shape means updating the doc in the same
  change. If a diagram no longer earns its upkeep, delete it.
- **Prose frames, diagram shows.** Each doc is a markdown file: a sentence or
  two of context and the question, then the Mermaid block, then any caveats. The
  doc is not an essay — the diagram carries the weight.
