# Architecture

Architecture is deciding how to organize the solutions to problems at each
altitude, and within each deployable. It is concerned with how systems interact:
interfaces, contracts, composability, data flows.

Related skills: name every boundary, layer, and module with the `naming` skill.
Draw the shapes you design — systems, layers, data flows — with the
`diagramming` skill. When architecture work reaches the unit level, hand off:
`write-class` for classes, `write-function` for functions.

## Altitudes

Software exists at five altitudes: system ⊃ feature ⊃ module ⊃ unit ⊃ line.
Architecture operates at each one. Know which altitude you're working at, and
produce the artifacts of that altitude.

| Altitude        | Scope                       | Activities                                                                                  | Artifacts produced                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5 — System**  | the whole product           | design the architecture, define sub-systems and boundaries, audit system health, scope work | layers, boundaries, sub-systems, tickets                  |
| **4 — Feature** | one user-facing capability  | design a feature, plan/break down the work, build the feature, verify end-to-end, ship      | feature folder, wiring in the composition root, e2e tests |
| **3 — Module**  | one concept / folder        | shape a module, define its public API, place files, assign layer membership                 | files, folders, exports                                   |
| **2 — Unit**    | one function / class / type | write a function, write a class, write a method, design a type, write a unit test           | functions, classes, methods, types, tests                 |
| **1 — Line**    | one statement / expression  | name a variable, choose a data structure, shape a conditional, extract a constant           | statements, expressions, names                            |

## System shape

- Favor simple systems. Every system should be small enough to hold in your head
  and explain in a sentence. When one grows past that, don't manage the
  complexity — split it into sub-systems, each simple again, with a clear
  boundary between them.
- Favor composability. Necessary complexity lives in the _organization and
  composition_ of simple parts, not inside the parts themselves. Build small
  pieces with clean contracts and compose them into larger behavior; a complex
  organization of simple systems is debuggable and testable piecewise, a simple
  organization of complex systems is neither.

## Deployables

- A software system must be built into a deployable. Sometimes a system maps
  cleanly to one deployable unit; as it grows it subdivides into sub-systems,
  which map to one or more deployables that together deliver the working system.
- A system splits first into deployables — client, server, data store.
  Deployables are systems (or sub-systems): separately deployed, connected only
  by contracts (API schemas, DTOs). The full-stack pipeline is composed of
  pieces chained end to end: data → server API → client fetch → view.
- The patterns are fractal and repeat _inside every deployable_. The server has
  its own core (domain model), adapters (DB access, outbound HTTP), coordination
  (route handlers), and entry (server bootstrap). The client has its own core
  (models, state transitions), adapters (API client, DOM rendering),
  coordination (feature controllers), and entry (app bootstrap).
- A deployable's boundary is a hard contract: schema-validated at the edge
  (parse, don't validate). Neither deployable imports the other's internals;
  they share only the contract types.

## Layers (within a deployable)

Base pattern: functional core / imperative shell. Four levels, from inside out:

1. **Core** — pure functions and types. Domain logic, state transitions,
   calculations. No I/O, no DOM, no clock, no random.
2. **Adapters** — the code that touches the world: persistence, network, DOM
   rendering. Each adapter wraps one external thing. This is where side effects
   live.
3. **Coordination** — orchestrators/controllers that sequence core and adapters
   into features (see the `naming` skill's coordination rule). Delegates only;
   owns no business logic.
4. **Entry point** — the composition root (`main`/`app`). Constructs everything,
   wires it together, starts it. The only place that knows the whole graph.

Rules that bind across the layers:

- Named patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM) are mappings onto these layers: Model → core;
  View → an adapter over the display (rendering is I/O); Controller / Presenter
  / ViewModel → coordination. Whatever names the pattern uses, the invariant it
  protects is the same: strong model/view separation — models never know views
  exist. Follow the pattern the codebase has chosen; map its names to these
  layers to know which rules bind.
- Dependencies point inward, only inward. Shell imports core; core never imports
  shell. A lower layer never knows a higher layer exists.
- Favor one-way data flow. One loop: event → state transition (pure, in the
  core) → render from the new state. State flows down, events flow up; the view
  never writes state directly and nothing renders from anything but state. Each
  piece of state has exactly one owner; everything else receives it read-only or
  derives from it (computed, not stored). Two-way binding and scattered mutation
  make "who changed this?" unanswerable.
- Boundaries are types owned by the inner layer — core defines the interface
  (`Clock`, `UserStore`), adapters implement it. That's dependency inversion;
  it's what keeps the core testable without mocks of the outside world.
- Logic drifts toward the core over time: if a coordinator or adapter grows an
  `if` about the domain, extract it into a pure function and call it (see
  `write-function`).
- No cycles, at any level — two modules that import each other are one module
  that hasn't admitted it, or a missing third concept both should depend on.
- Test probe: the core's tests run with no test doubles for I/O. If a "pure"
  test needs a mock, the code under test is in the wrong layer.

## Files & folders

- Organize by feature/domain first, by layer second — folder names should say
  what the app _does_ (`checkout/`, `profile/`), not what framework it uses.
- Things that change together live together — a unit's test, types, and styles
  colocate with it (or follow the project's stated convention).
- One concept per file; file named for its primary export (see `naming`).
- A folder is a module with a public API: what it exports deliberately is the
  surface; reaching deep into another folder's internals is a boundary
  violation.
- Dependency direction between folders follows the layer rules — shared code
  sits below the features that use it (`shared/` never imports from a feature).
- Start flat; add structure when forced. A new folder needs a nameable concept
  and ~3+ files. Empty scaffolding "for later" is speculative generality.
- Deletability test: a feature done right disappears by deleting its folder plus
  its wiring line(s) in the composition root. The more places a feature leaks
  into, the worse its boundaries.

## Project-specific rules

- Adhere to WCAG guidelines when architecting UI features.
- If you find two conflicting patterns in the codebase, ask the user whether one
  should be refactored away in favor of the canonical pattern.
- Unit test individual core functions; integration test the shell to ensure
  business and customer value is intact.
- Code is for _what and how_; comments are for _why and when_.
